TESTS 7D, 7E & 7E

The STATUS.LST file has been added to Tests 7d, 7e and 7f. This file had originally been omitted.

TEST 7F

This test has been reworked as the original test for versions 1.1 and earlier was flawed.

TEST 7H

The location of Base Cell, GB50162B.000 was incorrectly identified as "B2" in the PRODUCTS.TXT file on the update media. This has been corrected in the PRODUCTS.TXT file as "B3".

TEST 8C

M01X02 Base Media - PRODUCTS.TXT File
GB100004.000 - Change "M1;U1" to "M1;B1"
Reason being if the update media was unavailable the system must be able to load from the base media.

TEST 8D

Correct the format and contents as follows:

1. BASE MEDIA, MEDIA.TXT file was missing the second header line. This has been corrected in v1.2.

2. UPDATE MEDIA, STATUS.LST file header was not consistent with the MEDIA.TXT file. This has been corrected on v1.2.

3. Amend PRODUCTS.TXT file on UPDATE media for cell GB100001 for consistency with the BASE media.

4. Amend PRODUCTS.TXT file on UPDATE media for cell GB100004 (Update 10) for consistency with this UPDATE Exchange Set.
